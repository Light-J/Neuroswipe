    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>As a hub for neuroscience, we house multiple brain imaging facilities under one roof.
        We play a pivotal role in the global endeavour to better understand the causes of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as dementia,
        schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, so as to yield vital clues for the development of better treatments.</p>
